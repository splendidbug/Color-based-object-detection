# Color-based-object-detection
This is a color based object detection project purely on C++ designed to print a box around the detected object.

The input image is converted to HSV color space and extract dominant colors and draw a box based on a cluster of those pixels in the test image.

To run:

```Main.cpp object_image.jpeg test_image.jpeg```
